### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a final-year Ph.D. student at Language Technology Lab, University of Cambridge. I am broadly interested in natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning. Some of my research areas include prototype-augmented text generation, non-autoregressive text generation, and task-oriented dialogue systems. Recently, I focus my research on the topic of contrastive learning and the study of its potential in language model pre-training, discourse representation learning, knowledge probing, open-ended text generation, and plug-and-play multi-modal text generation.
